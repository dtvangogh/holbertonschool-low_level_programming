## 0x07. C - Recursion

This repository contains more projects introducing the use, purpose or recursion. Below is a list of the projects following a description for each of them.

| File                    | Description                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0-puts_recursion.c      | A function that prints a string, followed by a new line. This function is similar to the standard library function: `puts`. |
| 1-print_rev_recursion.c | A function that prints a string, in reverse. |
| 2-strlen_recursion.c    | A function that returns the length of a string. This function is similar to the standard library function: `strlen`. |
| 3-factorial.c           | A function that returns the factorial of a given number. If the given number is lower than `0`, the function returns `-1`. |
| 4-pow_recursion.c       | a function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`. If `y` is lower than `0`, then function should return `-1`. This is simialr to the standard library function: `pow`. |
| 5-sqrt_recursion.c      | A function that returns the natural square root of a number. If the number does not have a natual square root, the function returns `-1`. The standard library function provides a similar function: `sqrt`. |
| 6-is_prime_number.c     | A function that returns 1 if a number is a [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number), 0 otherwise. |
| 7-is_palindrome.c       | A function that returns `1` if a string is a palindrome and `0` if not. An empty string is a palindrome. |
| 100-wildcmp.c           | A function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered as identical, and `0` otherwise. The second string, `s2` can containe the special character `*`. The special chracters `*` can replace any string (including an empty string). |
