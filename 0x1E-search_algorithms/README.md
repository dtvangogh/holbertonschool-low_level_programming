# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
## Description
 This project is part of Foundations - Low-level programming & Algorithm â€• Data structures and Algorithms:
## Project tasks :wrench:
### [0. Linear search ](./0-linear.c) 
* Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
### [1. Binary search ](./0x1E-search_algorithms) 
* Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
### [2. Big O #0 ](./1-binary.c) 
* What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?
